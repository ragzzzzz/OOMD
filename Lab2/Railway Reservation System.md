### Railway Reservation System 

**Aim**: To write the Problem Statement and Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a Railway Reservation System.

**Problem Statement**: Develop a Railway Reservation Software System that allows passengers to book tickets, cancel bookings, check train schedules, and manage 
reservations online. The system should also allow the railway authorities to manage train schedules, allocate seats, and manage train routes and fares efficiently. 
The system should be user-friendly, secure, reliable, and scalable to handle a large number of simultaneous users.

**1. Introduction**:

**1.1 Purpose**: The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of a railway reservation software system, which will enable users to book, modify and cancel railway tickets online.

**1.2 Scope**: This document outlines the objectives and scope of the railway reservation software system, along with the estimated development cost and timeline

**1.3 Overview**: The railway reservation software system will provide a user-friendly platform for passengers to book and manage their railway tickets online, reducing the need for manual ticket booking and providing greater convenience to users.

**2. General Description**: The railway reservation software system will allow passengers to book railway tickets online through a user-friendly interface, with features including real-time train availability, seat selection, and payment processing. 
The system will cater to a diverse user community, including passengers with different levels of technical expertise, mobility needs, and language preferences.

**3. Design Constraints**:
The railway reservation software system should be designed to comply with industry standards and best practices, with a modular and scalable architecture. The system should be designed to be easily maintainable and extensible, with clear separation of concerns and a robust error handling mechanism. The system should also be designed to work with existing infrastructure and systems, such as payment gateways and train schedules.

**4. Interface Requirements**:
The railway reservation software system should provide a user interface that is intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and feedback messages for users. The system should communicate with users through a variety of interfaces, including web browsers, mobile applications, and email notifications. The system should also communicate with external systems, such as payment gateways and train schedules, through standard interfaces such as APIs.

**5. Performance Requirements**:
The railway reservation software system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users, with fast response times and minimal downtime. The system should be able to handle peak loads during festival seasons and other busy periods, without compromising on performance. The system should also be able to handle unexpected errors and failures, with built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms.

**6. Functional Requirements**:
The functional requirements of the railway reservation software system include the following:
- Users should be able to search for available trains by specifying the source and destination stations, date and time of travel, and class of travel.
- Users should be able to view the train schedule, fare, and seat availability for their chosen route and date.
- Users should be able to select their preferred seat(s) and book their ticket(s) online, with payment processing through a secure payment gateway.
- Users should be able to view and manage their booked tickets, including modifying or canceling their booking if necessary.
- The system should generate e-tickets with all necessary details, including the passenger name, train number, seat number, and journey details.
- The system should provide a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback messages, catering to users with different levels of technical expertise and language preferences.
 
**7. Non-Functional Attributes**:
The railway reservation software system should comply with various non-functional attributes, such as security, portability, reliability, reusability, application compatibility, data integrity, and scalability. The system should provide a secure platform for users to book and manage their tickets, with built-in security mechanisms such as encryption and authentication. The system should also be portable, compatible with different operating systems and devices, and provide reliable and consistent performance across different environments.
