### Stock Maintenance System 

**Aim**: To write the Problem Statement and Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a Stock Maintenance System.

**Problem Statement**: Develop a stock maintenance system that allows businesses to easily track inventory levels, monitor stock movement, and generate real-time reports. 
This system will help businesses streamline their inventory management processes, reduce errors, and make data-driven decisions to optimize their stock levels.

**1. Introduction**:

**1.1) Purpose**: The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for a stock maintenance software system.

**1.2) Scope**: This document describes the overall working and main objective of the stock maintenance software system, and the value it will provide to the customer. It also includes a description of the development cost and time required.

**1.3) Overview**: The stock maintenance software system is designed to assist businesses in maintaining accurate records of their inventory, including stock levels, product information, and supplier details.

**2. General Description**: The stock maintenance software system is intended for use by businesses of all sizes that manage inventory. The system will provide users with the ability to track inventory levels, monitor stock movements, and generate reports on stock availability, pricing, and trends. The software will be easy to use, with an intuitive interface that is suitable for users of all levels of experience.

**3. Design Constraints**: The stock maintenance software system must be designed to operate on a variety of hardware and software platforms. The system must also be designed to be scalable, with the ability to handle increased volumes of data as the business grows.

**4. Interface Requirements**: The stock maintenance software system will communicate with users through a graphical user interface (GUI). The system will also communicate with other software systems, such as accounting software, through APIs.

**5. Performance Requirements**: The stock maintenance software system must be able to perform its functions efficiently and accurately, with a low error rate. The system should be able to handle large volumes of data, and provide quick response times to user queries.

**6. Functional Requirements**: The stock maintenance software system must be able to perform the following functions:
- Track inventory levels and locations
- Record product information, including name, description, SKU, and supplier details
- Monitor stock movements, including incoming and outgoing shipments, and product transfers between locations
- Generate reports on inventory levels, stock movements, pricing, and trends
- Provide users with the ability to set minimum and maximum stock levels and receive alerts when these levels are reached
- Allow for the creation and management of purchase orders
- Provide an interface for the management of supplier information, including contact details and payment terms 

**7. Non-Functional Attributes**: The stock maintenance software system must be secure, with the ability to protect user data from unauthorized access. The system should also be reliable, with the ability to recover from errors and system failures. The system should be easy to maintain and update, with a modular design that allows for easy addition of new features.

**8. Preliminary Schedule and Budget**: The development of the stock maintenance software system is expected to take six months, with a budget of $100,000. This budget includes the cost of software development, testing, and implementation, as well as any necessary hardware and software purchases.
