### Passport Automation System

**Aim**: To write the Problem Statement and Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a Passport Automation System.

**Problem Statement**: The current passport application process involves several manual steps, leading to long wait times, inefficiencies, and errors. To 
address these issues, a passport automation software system is needed to streamline the process and enhance the user experience. The software should allow users to 
easily apply for passports online, track their application status, and schedule appointments at passport centers. The system should also ensure data security and 
accuracy, and be scalable to accommodate increasing volumes of passport applications.

**1. Introduction**:

**1.1 Purpose**: The purpose of this document is to define the system requirements for a passport automation software system

**1.2 Scope**: The scope of this document is to describe the functionality, objectives, benefits, and value of the passport automation software system, as well as the development cost and time required

**1.3 Overview**: This section provides an overview of the passport automation software system, including a summary of its features and benefits.

**2. General Description**: The passport automation software system aims to automate the passport application process, improve the accuracy of data, and provide a user-friendly interface for both applicants and passport office staff. It will feature online application submission, automated form validation, biometric verification, and real-time status updates. The system is designed for use by both citizens and government officials.

**3. Design Constraints**: The passport automation software system should adhere to all relevant government regulations and guidelines. The system should also be designed to work on a variety of hardware and software platforms.

**4. Interface Requirements**: The system should have user-friendly interfaces for both applicants and passport office staff. These interfaces should include data input screens, data validation messages, and real-time status updates.

**5. Performance Requirements**: The system should be able to handle a high volume of passport applications and process them in a timely and accurate manner. The system should also have a maximum error rate of less than 1%.

**6. Functional Requirements**: The passport automation software system should be able to process passport applications, validate form data, capture biometric information, and issue passports. The system should also provide real-time status updates and generate reports. All functional requirements should be ranked in order of importance. 

**7. Non-Functional Attributes**: The passport automation software system should be secure, reliable, portable, and compatible with other systems. The system should also ensure data integrity, scalability, and reusability.
