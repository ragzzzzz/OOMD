### Online Shopping System

**Aim**: To write the Problem Statement and Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for an Online Shopping System.

**Problem Statement**: To design an online shopping software system that allows customers to browse products, add items to their cart, make payments, and track order 
statuses. The system should also allow administrators to manage products, view order information, and generate reports.

**1. Introduction**:

**1.1 Purpose**: The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for an online shopping software system

**1.2 Scope**: This document describes the objectives and values that the software system will provide to the customers. It also includes the estimated cost and time 
required for development

**1.3 Overview**: This section provides a brief summary of the online shopping software system.

**2. General Description**:
The software system should be able to provide a platform for customers to browse and purchase products online. The system should have features such as a shopping cart, order tracking, and a search function. The system should be user-friendly and accessible to people of all ages and technical backgrounds.

**3.  Design Constraints**:
The software system should be designed to be compatible with a variety of platforms and devices. It should be designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices. The system should be designed to be scalable, allowing for future expansion.

**4. Interface Requirements**:
The software system should have a user-friendly interface that allows customers to easily navigate and use the system. It should have a clear layout, and customers should be able to find the products they are looking for quickly and easily.

**5. Performance Requirements**:
The software system should be able to handle a large number of users and transactions simultaneously without crashing. It should have fast response times and minimal downtime. It should be able to handle a large volume of product data without slowing down.

**6. Functional Requirements**:
The software system should be able to perform the following functions:
- Allow customers to browse products by category or keyword search
- Provide detailed information about each product
- Allow customers to add products to a shopping cart
- Allow customers to make payments securely
- Provide customers with an order confirmation and tracking information

**7. Non-Functional Attributes**:
